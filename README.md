## Basic demonstration project working through some libpython-clj2 usage bugs


To fire up, run

    docker-compose up --bulid

or alternatively, this should work too if you have a newer docker install

    docker compose up --build

Connect to the open nREPL port (9876 if it doesn't connect automatically), and try evaluating the code in
`src/libpython_test/test.clj`.
